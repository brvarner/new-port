  `I'm a software engineer and seasoned communications professional interested in web, mobile, desktop, and video game development.`,
  `I started my career in media, and have nearly a decade of experience in public relations, copywriting, blogging, and television. 
  I also hold a B.A. in Professional Writing and Public Discourse from the University of Alabama at Birmingham.`,
  `Over the last three years, I've professionally pivoted to software development. I started my coding career as a Founding Engineer at a startup. 
  Through that job, rigorous educational experiences, and self-learning, I've cultivated skills in HTML, CSS, 
              JavaScript, Java, C++, Next.js, Ruby on Rails, and more. You can see the full scope of tools in the tech stack section below.`,
  `I'm a voracious learner, and a highly motivated self-starter. I recently completed a
              highly competitive job training program from the University of
              Illinois's Discovery Partners Institute. This program helped me improve my coding skills, while also allowing me to meet with executives and senior developers to learn more about the business side of coding.`,
  `I'm hoping that my next coding opportunity will be a fruitful chance
              to learn and grow as a developer.
                  I'm available for contract work and full-time employment.

  `In my free time, I'm usually hanging out with my wife,
